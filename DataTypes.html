Computers can only store information as 1s and 0s. As this is hard to remember and use quickly, and standard was created, stating that a certain combination of 1s and 0s represented
a certain character, called the American Standard Character Information Interchange (ASCII). 
<br><br>
This was initially limited to 7 bits, meaning that there could be 128 separate 
characters (shown to the right), which when you take into account that this had to include numbers, letters, special symbols such as !, ? etc. as well as other languages, this was not a lot of 
characters. This was later extended to 8 bits, meaning that 256 different characters could now be stored.
<br><br>
Later on, UNICODE was created, which was 16 bits long, and could store 65,536 different characters, a vast improvement on the original ASCII. Since then, the 16 bit limit has been
 lifted, and so there is an unlimited number of combinations for characters, although the original ASCII still occupies the first 256 characters.

<h3 class="Subheader" align="center">BOOLEAN DATA</h3>
<div>
Boolean data can only take one of two values; true or false. These are very useful for testing in programs in IF statements to test if a condition is met. For example, if a>b (true/
false). This data only needs to be 1 bit, as there are only two possible values; true (1), or false(0).

The main system that we use in our daily lives is Base 10, Decimal, or the Denary system. It is known as Base 10, as there are 10 characters (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) before we 
move onto the next column in the system, and each column in the system is multiplied by 10. The number above is 5,743 as there are 5 thousands, 7 hundreds, 3 tens and 4 units. 
As one column is filled up, when the value is increased by one then the column is set to zero, and the next column up is increased by 1.

<div class="TableDiv">
This is a computer's main system. This is base 2, or the binary system, because each column is multiplied by 2, and each column can only be one of 2 characters, 1 or a 0. When a column
 needs to go higher than a 1, that column is set back to zero, and the next column is increased to 1.
 <br><br>
 To convert from base 2 to base 10, we just add all of the column headings together that have a 1 beneath them. The number above is 151, as 128 + 16 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 151.
 <br><br>
 To convert from base 10 to base 2, there are 2 different methods. one method is where you simply start in the 128 column, and see if that fits into your number, if so, take that away from
 the number and put a 1 in this column, and move onto the next one. This is repeated until the required number is reached. <br>
 The other method is the divide method, as shown below:<br>
 163 / 2 = 81 remainder <b>1</b><br>
 81 / 2 = 40 remainder <b>1</b><br>
 40 / 2 = 20 remainder <b>0</b><br>
 20 / 2 = 10 remainder <b>0</b><br>
 10 / 2 = 5 remainder <b>0</b><br>
 5 / 2 = 2 remainder <b>1</b><br>
 2 / 2 = 1 remainder <b>0</b><br>
 1 / 2 = 0 remainder <b>0</b><br>
and so the binary number for 163 is 11000100, as you add the remainders from each sum.

<div class="TableDiv">
The above is an example of the 'Two's complement' method for showing a negative integer in binary. It takes the MSB (Most Significant Bit) from the binary code, in this case, 128,
 and makes it negative. Now, if there is a 1 there, you start at -128, and every 1 after that is added on, but the number will always be negative if there is a negative 128, as if all
  the other columns had a 1, the highest number you could get would be -1. The number shown above is -98, as -128 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1 = -98.

<div class="TableDiv">
This table is an example of the 'Sign and Magnitude method of writing a negative number in binary. It works by storing the sign of the number (- or +) as a bit, and then using the 
rest of the 8 bits to make the number up as you normally would, however, since the 128 is gone, the highest (or lowest if using the -) number you can get is 127, however this is the
 same amount as in two's complement, however that method can get 1 lower in the negatives. It is worth noting that it is not always the 128 that is replaced, but it just happens to 
be the most significant bit in an 8 bit number. For this example, the number is -69, as 64 + 1 + 4 = 69, and the sign is a 1, so it is negative.
